# Swing Café App
This is the *first* application I made in my engineering days.

The day we completed our second semester learning OOP with Java.  
One of my friend approached me with an idea to create this app for his café.
In the following vacation I got to it and made something usable.

Got these files from email and to my surprise it still works :D
